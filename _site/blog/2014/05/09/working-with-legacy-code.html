		<p>Every software engineer feels a sense disgust when hearing the words <em>legacy code</em>. Strictly speaking legacy code it’s code you “inherit” from someone else, however, the term is more broadly used to indicate a piece of software that’s no longer maintained. Often it’s code that, although deprecated, is still in use because of dependencies spread across a large system. Anyway, Michael Feathers has a better definition</p>

<!-- more -->

<blockquote>
  <p>To me, <em>legacy code</em> is simply code without tests. I’ve gotten some grief for this definition. What do tests have to do with whether code is bad? To me, the answer is straightforward, and it is a point that I elaborate throughout the book:</p>

  <p><em>Code without tests is bad code. It doesn’t matter how well written it is; it doesn’t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior or our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don’t know if our code is getting better or worse.</em></p>

  <p>You might think that this is severe. What about clean code? If a code base is very clean and well structured, isn’t that enough? Well, make no mistake. I love clean code. I love it more than most people I know, but while clean code is good, it’s not enough. Teams take serious chances when they try to make large changes without tests. It is like doing aerial gymnastic without a net. It requires incredible skill and a clear understanding of what can happen at every step. Knowing precisely what will happen if you change a couple of variables is often like knowing whether another gymnast is going to catch your arms after you come out of a somersault.

<p>I wish I had read Michael Feathers’ <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005OYHF0A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B005OYHF0A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gtranchedone-21">Effectively Working with Legacy Code</a> when I first started programming. I’ve had it on my Amazon wish-list for a long time. One day I’ve purchased the book but I’ve committed the sin of not reading it until just a few days ago. <strong>If you are - or want to be - a software engineer you absolutely have to read this book now! <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005OYHF0A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B005OYHF0A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gtranchedone-21">Go get it!</a></strong></p>

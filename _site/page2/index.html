				<p>Disclaimer: This post is based on an answer on StackOverflow to the question “How Can One Transfer Xcode 4 Code Snippets From One Machine To Another?”. I&#39;ve tried the following method myself and it works like magic. I&#39;m also using it to sync Xcode&#39;s custom colour schemes and other user-specific data across my Macs.

Xcode&#39;s Code Snippets are located in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/. If you want to have all your code snippets synchronised between multiple Macs, you can use Dropbox to do so.

				<p>Since the introduction of the App Store, and even more when the Mac App Store arrived, a lot of discussion has been made around apps&#39; pricing models. Only last year a debate about the need for paid app upgrades raised among developers, but it eventually fade off… until a couple of weeks ago, when Apple released Logic Pro X as a separate, full-priced, app - deprecating the existing Logic Pro on the Store.

With this launch, Apple has reclaimed its intention of not allowing any paid upgrade to apps. Moreover, by a quick analysis of the apps featured by Apple in the last few months, it also appears that they prefer the freemium model over paid apps in general, although most of theirs aren&#39;t actually free. Games are the only kind of apps that actually sees a major featured rate even when they&#39;re in sale or free. What developers can do then to guarantee themselves an income after the initial sale then?

				<p>When I started using version control systems (VCS) a few years ago, I&#39;ve searched for the best way to integrate external repositories into my own. At that time, everyone I knew was simply copying the contents of those repositories into their project and eventually maintain that code alongside their own, often without giving anything back when fixing bugs in opens source libraries. What I was looking for, instead, was a way to integrate such libraries so that it would be trivial to get updates or to contribute back to those projects; but most of all, I wanted to share reusable components across multiple projects in a way that allowed me to only maintain the shared code once and get updates everywhere instantly. It turns out that all the most used VCS support such think in a way or another, but, as you&#39;ll see by the time you finish reading this, there also are tools that do not strictly require a specific VCS in order to accomplish the same task.

				<p>Edit (16 Feb 2015): A long time has passed since I originally wrote this post and I believe it can very well be considered out of date. As a matter of fact I’ve recently published a new post titled “Why AppCode has become my IDE of choice”.

A few months ago I heard about AppCode, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Objective-C developed by the Czech software studio JetBrains. JetBrains is a well-known company in the software development community for their other IDEs (IntelliJ Idea for Java, PyCharm for Python, RubyMine for Ruby, etc.) and for their Continuous Integration products. Many Java developers favor JetBrains&#39;s IDE over Eclipse, especially since JetBrains released a &#39;Community Supported&#39;, and thus free, version of IntelliJ Idea. Moreover, Google recently partnered with the Czech company to create a dedicated IDE for Android, which is basically going to be a simplified version of IntelliJ: Android Studio.

Fellow Cocoa(-Touch) developers, at least from what I could see or hear, are either uninterested or very excited about AppCode. As for myself, I&#39;ve had mixed feelings about trying AppCode for development with Objective-C, but after having spent some time gathering more information about it, I&#39;ve decided to give AppCode a try by taking advantage of the 30-days free trial being offered by JetBrains. I&#39;ve used AppCode for the entire trial period now and I&#39;d like to share my thoughts on it… and as I&#39;ve spoiled from this post&#39;s title, I&#39;m going to explain why I&#39;m not going to use it anymore.

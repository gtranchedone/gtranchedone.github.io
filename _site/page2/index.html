		<h1>The App Store Business: do we need Paid Upgrades or can we live with In-App Purchase only?</h1>
	</a>
	<h4 class="meta">Posted on 27 August 2013<!--  | Reading time: <p>Since the introduction of the App Store, and even more when the Mac App Store arrived, a lot of discussion has been made around apps&#39; pricing models. Only last year a debate about the need for paid app upgrades raised among developers, but it eventually fade off… until a couple of weeks ago, when Apple released Logic Pro X as a separate, full-priced, app - deprecating the existing Logic Pro on the Store.</p>

<p>With this launch, <strong>Apple has reclaimed its intention of not allowing any paid upgrade to apps</strong>. Moreover, by a quick <a href="http://daveaddey.com/appstore/">analysis of the apps featured by Apple in the last few months</a>, it also appears that they prefer the freemium model over paid apps in general, although most of theirs aren&#39;t actually free. Games are the only kind of apps that actually sees a major featured rate even when they&#39;re in sale or free. <strong>What developers can do then to guarantee themselves an income after the initial sale then?</strong></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>As well noted by <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-puts-its-price-tag-where-its-policy-charges-full-price-logic-pro-x-mac-app-store">Rene Ritchie in his article about the Logic Pro X update</a> and what it means for developers, publishers basically have 3 ways to handle apps&#39; updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep the same app and make the update free for each existing customer.</li>
<li>Make a new app and temporarily reduce its cost, so existing users don&#39;t have to pay full price again, and allow new users to take advantage of the reduced price as well, which might be good to boost the ranking of the new app.</li>
<li>Make a new app and keep it at full price so everyone, existing users and new users alike, pay top dollar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of this has a drawback for either the developer or the customer… or both, as somebody might argue. Many have already faced the hard choice of going for one of this options and results, we saw it with <a href="https://twitter.com/gedeon/status/357980681965543425">Twitterrific</a>, may vary. If you are an independent developer and you haven&#39;t updated an app for a while like me, or if you&#39;re reworking one of your apps from scratch you&#39;re likely to face this choice yourself.</p>

<h2>The case for trial periods and paid updates</h2>

<p>Some people rightfully raised concerns about visibility on the App Stores. How are people supposed to find your great apps among hundreds of similar apps? Just search for &#39;Twitter&#39; or &#39;Todo&#39; or &#39;Calendar&#39; on the App Store and you&#39;ll get hundreds of different results, all formatted the same way and most likely with similar app icons. Now, this might appear as a separate issue, and in part it is, but what happens when hundreds of developers start publishing and keeping on the Stores two or more versions of the same app? We&#39;ll have millions of apps, all doing the same things and therefore polluting the App Stores, which of course means that the chances to be visible to customers gets greatly reduced compared to what it used to be once or what it is today.</p>

<p>I agree with Elia Freedman when he says that <a href="http://eliainsider.com/2013/07/29/the-app-store-problem-is-not-price/">the App Store problem is not price</a>. Trials might improve discovery of great apps without getting the user to spend money on different apps before they find yours. Moreover it would cut the need for a &#39;light&#39; version of the app and thus for duplications that make other apps less visible. I&#39;d also like to see videos embedded in the details page of apps on the App Store.</p>

<p>Somebody, I can&#39;t remember who, also argued that <strong>with iOS 7 the discovery of good apps should get a boost thanks to the new design which will make old/non-maintained apps look… well, old</strong>. I couldn&#39;t agree more. This is a perfect time to update your app if you&#39;ve been delaying it for a while and it&#39;s also a good change to submit the update as a separate app and charge full price for it.</p>

<p>This leads us to the paid upgrade proposal many are trying to push. Although I can see why fellow developers want to charge for upgrades I actually agree with the position taken by Apple on this front: you should publish a new, separate, app if, and only if, you feel the effort needed to produce it overcome the disadvantages that doing so implies. Otherwise, you should take advantage of the in-app purchase mechanism to charge for your latest and greatest features.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t fully agree with Dave Addey when in his post &#39;<a href="http://daveaddey.com/?p=1084">Apps are too cheap</a>&#39; he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although IAPs can be used to purchase additional functionality, this doesn’t fit with user expectations of how new functionality is generally made available. The expectation is that if an update is free to download, any new functionality within that update should be free to access, and shouldn’t require an IAP to unlock it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I expect as a user from an update is that known issues had been resolved, that something got improved or that there&#39;s <em>some</em> new feature. Updates, by all means, don&#39;t have to only contain new features that are given out for free. Apps like Evernote and many games quite successfully have integrated this philosophy of &#39;freemium upgrades&#39; to their product development cycle. <strong>Apps can get new features reserved to services Premium subscribers or available through In-App Purchase</strong> (either as a one-time purchase or as a subscription) and Games can get new levels available as achievements or as a purchase.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the advantage of using in-app purchases over payed upgrades? - you may ask. First of all <strong>purchasable features would allow to keep the cost of your app low, if not free in the first place, potentially making your app be downloaded by more people</strong>. At that point only those interested in the paid features will buy them. It&#39;s your responsibility then to promote those features to your users and make them want them. You can choose to sell the &#39;premium&#39; feature individually or/and in bundles. This would also allow to get some extra analytics on how popular a feature is and will make it easier for you to decide whether it&#39;s worth to keep it or not. Moreover, if you decide to pursue this model, an in-app trial of those premium features would move the control of what many have been asking for to you, and will let the users try your full app before having to choose whether to buy extras or not. Of course some of the paid features could be sold as an upgrade bundle within the app.</p>

<p>Still, as Apple or Tweettie 2 did, at some point releasing a new version of your app or game as a separate entity on the App Store might make sense. This, though, shouldn&#39;t become a rule for all updates, but only for <em>some</em> major versions of your software, when it really makes sense to do so. If you &#39;over-release&#39; updates as separate apps you might get the side effect of loosing visibility and customer trust, not to mention that Apple might prevent you from releasing yet another app with same/similar features than other software you sell on their stores.</p>

<p>How are you dealing with new features for you apps&#39; updates?</p>

		<h1>The best ways to integrate external repositories into your projects</h1>
	</a>
	<h4 class="meta">Posted on 09 August 2013<!--  | Reading time: <p>When I started using version control systems (VCS) a few years ago, I&#39;ve searched for the best way to integrate external repositories into my own. At that time, everyone I knew was simply copying the contents of those repositories into their project and eventually maintain that code alongside their own, often without giving anything back when fixing bugs in opens source libraries. What I was looking for, instead, was a way to integrate such libraries so that it would be trivial to get updates or to contribute back to those projects; but most of all, I wanted to share reusable components across multiple projects in a way that allowed me to only maintain the shared code once and get updates everywhere instantly. It turns out that all the most used VCS support such think in a way or another, but, as you&#39;ll see by the time you finish reading this, there also are tools that do not strictly require a specific VCS in order to accomplish the same task.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The first version control system I&#39;ve used has been SVN at my day-job. After few months, I discovered and started using Git for my side projects. SVN, although many companies still use it, has grown old, and I find Git to be much more incline to what a modern VCS should be. Therefore in this post I&#39;m only going to cover Git, but, if you still use SVN, you should definitely check <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.advanced.externals.html">SVN Externals</a> and the last part of this post where I talk about CocoaPods which you can use with SVN as well. However, nowadays Git is the most popular version control system thanks to its distributed nature and to services like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> that make trivial to manage a Git repository, handle pull-requests, comments, issues, etc. Most companies now use Git, especially newly formed ones that have no previous set of data in other system to migrate to Git. Migrating to Git from SVN is actually easier than what you think, GitHub also provides a migration tool, for example. If you&#39;re still using SVN or Mercure you should definitely give Git a try. Jeff Kreeftmeiier wrote a nice article about <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/">why you should use Git</a> and &quot;The Git Guys&quot; also wrote one about <a href="http://www.gitguys.com/topics/why-use-git-instead-of-a-legacy-version-control-system/">why you should use Git instead of other VCS</a>.</p>

<h2>Integrating other repositories into your own with Git Submodule</h2>

<p>So, you&#39;re using Git and have projects that you want to integrate in one of your own. It doesn&#39;t really matter whether those projects belong to you or other developers: what matters is that they must also be stored in Git repositories. If this requirements are satisfied you&#39;re ready to integrate other repositories into your own using Git Submodule.</p>

<p>Git Submodule is a feature of Git that allows us to achieve what I&#39;ve just described. What it does is simply to store a reference to external repositories in a file, keeping their trees apart from your own. This means that all changes to those trees can be fetched as usual using the command &#39;git pull&#39;. Adding a submodule to your project is also trivial: you just have to type in the Terminal</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">cd [your repository folder]
git submodule add [repository url] [path where you want to store the submodule]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Git will clone the repository at the specified path and of course make it a submodule of your repository. You just need to execute a couple of other commands, namely</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">git submodule update --init [path]
</code></pre></div>
<p>and optionally</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">cd [the submodule folder]
git checkout [branch]
</code></pre></div>
<p>So far so good, but Git Submodule is not all a bed of roses. Don&#39;t mistake me, it&#39;s a great tool, I&#39;ve been using it in all the projects I&#39;ve worked on for the past 3 years, and I&#39;m still using it for most of them. Unfortunately, though, it comes with a couple of drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing a submodule is far from being a smooth operation: there&#39;s no such think as &#39;git submodule remove [path]&#39;, at least at the time of this writing.</li>
<li>When cloning a repository containing submodules, Git doesn&#39;t automatically pull them too. This, though, can simply be solved by adding the recursive specifier to the pull command. Anyway, it still is a drawback to me as you need to know that the repository you&#39;re pulling has submodules and it&#39;s not really intuitive how to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Adding and maintaining a submodule still requires some manual effort, which is proportional to the number of submodules you use.</li>
<li>Maintaining trees of submodule dependencies (when you have submodules that have submodules that have submodules, etc.) can be tricky.</li>
<li>Adding a submodule clones the current state of the repository but it doesn&#39;t actually checkout any branch by default. This seems weird (because it is :D) and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve added a command to checkout a branch earlier when I explained how to add a submodule to your repository. You won&#39;t have problems with not having a branch checked out, but if you don&#39;t do it and you make changes to the submodule&#39;s content, some extra work is required to make things work well when committing the changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that tools like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview">SourceTree</a> make it easy to perform all of this operations and often automatically take care of part of them. But still, the whole procedure is far from ideal. For more details about Git Submodule check the official page in the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git documentation</a>.</p>

<p>There also are a couple of alternatives to Git Submodule. One of the most appealing one is Git Subtree. Nicola Paolucci wrote an interesting article about <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/05/alternatives-to-git-submodule-git-subtree/">Git Subtree</a> that you might want to check out.</p>

<h2>A better integration tool for Cocoa(-Touch) Developers: CocoaPods</h2>

<p>Cocoa(-Touch) developers have an extra tool at their disposal to integrate other repositories into their own: <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>. CocoaPods is a Ruby gem that aims to be &quot;The best way to manage library dependencies in Objective-C&quot;, and it is! CocoaPods doesn&#39;t actually require the external projects to be stored into Git repositories, it should also work with other VCS. In a nutshell, what it does is getting a list of dependencies you specify in a file called &quot;Podfile&quot; (more about it later) and it generates a new Xcode project containing a static library out of each dependency and adds it to this new project; it then creates a Xcode workspace with your project and the libraries project. The command &#39;pod install&#39; and the workspace will make the dependency between the two projects implicit. Repositories you can use as dependencies, called &quot;pods&quot;, have to have a file in them with extension &#39;.podspec&#39; and they are usually be registered with CocoaPods. Most Open Source projects are available with CocoaPods, so you shouldn&#39;t worry about this at the moment. You can always contribute to unavailable Open Source projects and add a <a href="http://docs.cocoapods.org/specification.html">podspec</a> file to them yourself. Moreover, CocoaPods also supports private pods. Check the <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods official website</a> for more information.</p>

<p><del>In my last post I discussed why you should keep using Xcode and never move to AppCode; here&#39;s another reason: AppCode doesn&#39;t fully support workspaces and you cannot use CocoaPods with it.</del> (Edit: AppCode 2.5+ natively supports CocoaPods.)</p>

<p>This article doesn&#39;t want to be a comprehensive guide or tutorial on CocoaPods - a dedicated article may follow shortly, though - this is just an introduction to it written in order to discuss why you should consider using it in your projects. Therefore, just like I did with Git Submodule, I&#39;m just going to briefly tell you how to install CocoaPods on your machine and how to add your first dependencies to your project. The same instructions can be found on the CocoaPods&#39;s home page.</p>

<p>To install CocoaPods, open the Terminal and type the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">[sudo] gem install cocoapods
pod setup
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, go to your project&#39;s folder and create an empty text file called &#39;Podfile&#39; (the extension should be omitted, therefore it&#39;s better to simply write the command &#39;touch Podfile&#39; in a Terminal window to create it). CocoaPods will use this file to know what dependencies to add/update/remove to/from your project. Now, open the Podfile and add the following text in it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">platform :ios, &#39;6.1&#39;
pod &#39;AFNetworking&#39;
pod &#39;MagicalRecord&#39;, &#39;~&gt; 2.1&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first line of the file specifies the platform and version of your project. The second line specifies you want AFNetworking as a dependency. For AFNetworking, the latest available version will be used. The third line adds MagicalRecord as a second dependency, but in this case, using the specifier ~&gt; followed by a version number, we told CocoaPods that we want that version of the dependency and all the minor updates. In our example, therefore, MagicalRecord 2.1 will be downloaded and all subsequent versions up to but not including version 3.0. This is particularly useful to prevent that a major update to a Pod brakes your code or otherwise requires a major maintenance effort. You can find more information about the structure of the Podfile and what are the possible attributes you can add to each Pod here.</p>

<p>Now, close the file and go back to the Terminal. We&#39;re done with the preparations and it&#39;s time to actually install our dependencies. Type the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">pod install
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command tells CocoaPods to install all the dependencies contained in the Podfile. This command, as previously explained, will download the pods, create a project containing either a single library with all the dependencies or a single library for each of your dependencies, create or update an Xcode Workspace called as your project (e.g. &#39;MyProject.workspace) if needed, and add both your project and the CocoaPods project to it. If you previously had done this operation and modified the Podfile, any new dependency will be added and all the removed ones removed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it, we&#39;re done. From now on, you should only use the workspace created by CocoaPods to work on your project.</p>

<h2>Working with Pods</h2>

<p>One thing to notice is that pods usually come from repositories that were registered with CocoaPods (see the official documentation). What some may miss at first, but that might discover, soon is that not everything is on CocoaPods (yet :) ), especially internal libraries/components. What do you do when this happens? Can you still use CocoaPods for those? Of course you can! You just have to create a podspec for that library yourself! A podspec is a file where you specify information about a Pod. Once you&#39;ve done that you add this new pod in your Podfile as follows:</p>

<p>pod &#39;MyLibrary&#39;, :podspec =&gt; &#39;config/pods/MyLibrary.podspec&#39;
Another commonly asked question is how to integrate a local Pod in your project while still working on the Pod, or how to work on a local copy of a Pod. Well, CocoaPods got you covered for this situations as well with Local Pods! To add a Local Pod, you simply declare it in your Podfile as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">pod &#39;MyPod&#39;, :path =&gt; &#39;~/[some path]/MyPod/&#39;, :branch =&gt; &#39;develop&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<h2>CocoaPods Recap</h2>

<p>As you can see, CocoaPods has many advantages over Git Submodule:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintaining dependencies is almost entirely automated. You only have to make the initial effort of creating a Podfile and later you just have to update it when needed, but as you saw, it&#39;s trivial to do it: each dependency is specified in just one line of text.</li>
<li>You can use whatever VCS with it</li>
<li>It&#39;s easy to add and remove dependencies</li>
<li>Your dependencies are stored in a separate project from your main one
Although I haven&#39;t shown it in this post, you can also target dependencies to specific targets in your project (e.g. the unit tests bundle)</li>
</ul>

<p>The only drawback is that if you want to make changes to a Pod you don&#39;t have the source for yet, you first need to clone the repository, then change your Podfile to make that Pod local, and only then you can start applying changes to the pod. Clearly this is a very small price compared to the gain you get from CocoaPods.</p>

<p>Despite what many people think, CocoaPods has largely passed the point where it could be still considered an experiment or an &#39;under-construction&#39; product. The community around it is growing more and more everyday and most Open Source libraries support it. Actually, the most relevant ones, like MagicalRecord, AFNetworking and the like, are all advertising CocoaPods as the recommended installation method. The reasons for that are mostly described in this article.</p>

<p>Is CocoaPods problem-free then? Well… no. Although it has grown much in just a couple of years and although it&#39;s been supported almost full-time by many, CocoaPods is still young and the team behind it is discovering new usage patterns everyday. Moreover some known issues are reported on the project&#39;s page and will hopefully be fixed in the next versions. Normal usage, however should be error-free and everything should go smooth. If you encounter any problem with it, please report the issue to one of the team&#39;s members and they will hopefully also help you with it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Managing dependencies of your projects can be a daunting task and we should take advantage of all the tools at our disposal to make the job as easy as possible. Simply copying sources from project to project is just a waste of time and energy and you won&#39;t benefit from all the community or developer&#39;s support (or your own) to those sources if you don&#39;t have some sort of dependency management system that makes working on them project-independent.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re using Git, Git Submodule can be an invaluable ally when it comes to dependency management and it&#39;s definitely worth the effort, but if you&#39;re a Cocoa(-Touch) developer CocoaPods should become your best friend. It will save you a lot of time and make the whole process seamless. Both methods have their problems unfortunately but CocoaPods, being young and community supported, is most likely to get them fixed soon.</p>

				<p>When I started using version control systems (VCS) a few years ago, I&#39;ve searched for the best way to integrate external repositories into my own. At that time, everyone I knew was simply copying the contents of those repositories into their project and eventually maintain that code alongside their own, often without giving anything back when fixing bugs in opens source libraries. What I was looking for, instead, was a way to integrate such libraries so that it would be trivial to get updates or to contribute back to those projects; but most of all, I wanted to share reusable components across multiple projects in a way that allowed me to only maintain the shared code once and get updates everywhere instantly. It turns out that all the most used VCS support such think in a way or another, but, as you&#39;ll see by the time you finish reading this, there also are tools that do not strictly require a specific VCS in order to accomplish the same task.

		<h1>Why AppCode Is Still No Match for Xcode</h1>

	<h4 class="meta">Posted on 05 August 2013<!--  | Reading time: <p><em>Edit (16 Feb 2015): A long time has passed since I originally wrote this post and I believe it can very well be considered out of date. As a matter of fact I’ve recently published a new post titled “<a href="/2015/02/16/appcode">Why AppCode has become my IDE of choice</a>”.</em></p>

<p>A few months ago I heard about AppCode, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Objective-C developed by the Czech software studio <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a>. JetBrains is a well-known company in the software development community for their other IDEs (IntelliJ Idea for Java, PyCharm for Python, RubyMine for Ruby, etc.) and for their Continuous Integration products. Many Java developers favor JetBrains&#39;s IDE over Eclipse, especially since JetBrains released a &#39;Community Supported&#39;, and thus free, version of IntelliJ Idea. Moreover, Google recently partnered with the Czech company to create a dedicated IDE for Android, which is basically going to be a simplified version of IntelliJ: <a href="http://ccbeans.me/179eTAk">Android Studio</a>.</p>

<p>Fellow Cocoa(-Touch) developers, at least from what I could see or hear, are either uninterested or very excited about AppCode. As for myself, I&#39;ve had mixed feelings about trying AppCode for development with Objective-C, but after having spent some time gathering more information about it, I&#39;ve decided to give AppCode a try by taking advantage of the 30-days free trial being offered by JetBrains. I&#39;ve used AppCode for the entire trial period now and I&#39;d like to share my thoughts on it… and as I&#39;ve spoiled from this post&#39;s title, I&#39;m going to explain why I&#39;m not going to use it anymore.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>Price</h2>

<p>As you might have guessed by now, AppCode, as all other JetBrain&#39;s products, is a payed software. It&#39;s sold with a per-version licence for a premium of 99$ (76£ or 89€) for a personal licence. Students, teachers and no-profit institutions can get a licence for much less or entirely for free (but they need to apply for it). This kind of licence also implies that when a new version of the IDE gets published you&#39;ll get it for free if you purchased the full licence within the previous 12 months, otherwise you&#39;ll have to pay an extra 59$ (45£ or 53€) for each major update.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, AppCode might get quite expensive for companies or small development studios with few employees and if you also use other JetBrains&#39; products the overall cost is going to get quite high. Like many of you I honestly prefer Xcode for being free and available on the Mac App Store (which also means easy installation and updates). Xcode is thus the clear winner on this side. Moreover, all other Apple&#39;s amazing tools like Instruments or FileMerge come with Xcode and therefore are free as well.</p>

<h2>UI and Usability</h2>

<p>AppCode is written in Java, reusing many components of other JetBrains&#39; IDEs. Although perfectly understandable, this has the side effect of making AppCode slower than Xcode, especially if you compare it with the Xcode 5 Developer Preview (which is much faster and stable than Xcode 4). AppCode&#39;s slowness is especially noticeable when opening or creating a project.</p>

<p>Moreover, being build on top of the base for JetBrains&#39; other cross-platform IDEs, AppCode&#39;s UI is all but native. It can feel very tight as it has lots of controls squeezed together around the code editor. The only nice feature is the availability of a &#39;TODO&#39; tab that&#39;s automatically filled with the content of all comments starting with &#39;TODO:&#39; (e.g. &#39;// TODO: improve this bit of logic&#39; would appear in this tab as a TODO item). AppCode also has tons of settings, which some people might appreciate, but it makes it very hard to understand what the IDE can do and how to properly customize it. The code editor itself also doesn&#39;t leave quite a nice experience when typing code compared with Xcode: it just doesn&#39;t feel right.</p>

<p>The biggest drawback for AppCode, however, is that it relies heavily on Xcode for much of what it can do. First and most of all, you&#39;ve got to have Xcode installed on your machine in order for AppCode to function at all. AppCode, in fact, has to ask Xcode&#39;s folder structure for the available SDKs, project templates, and the iPhone Simulators. Moreover, editing XIBs, Storyboards, and Core Data Model files cannot be done in AppCode. Trying to open such files with AppCode will redirect you to Xcode. If you add to this the new fantastic features for images and game projects that Xcode 5 will support (which will be available though custom files formats in a visual editor), the gap in usability will become even larger (Xcode 5 is still in Developer Preview and under NDA, therefore I cannot fully talk about it yet).</p>

<p>Again Xcode is the clear winner on this side as well.</p>

<h2>Refactoring and Autocompletion</h2>

<p>Despite all the above, the strongest point of AppCode is for sure it&#39;s refactoring feature set. JetBrains&#39; IDEs have always been known for the extremely good support for refactoring and AppCode doesn&#39;t disappoint expectations in this area.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2013-08-05-xcode-vs-appcode/app_code-methods-generation.png" alt="App Code Method Generation"></p>

<p>There are so many refactoring features in AppCode it&#39;s impossible to cover them all in one post. Therefore I&#39;m only going to mention my favourites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creation of undeclared methods: if you&#39;re writing some code and decide you&#39;re going to wrap part of it in a new method, you can start calling that method and have AppCode create it for you.</li>
<li>Creation of undeclared ivars and properties: just as for methods, you can use undeclared ivars and properties and have AppCode declare them for you.</li>
<li>&quot;CamelHumps&quot; and &quot;Middle Matching&quot; autocompletion.</li>
<li>Automatic Import and Import Optimisation: When you start using a class that is not yet imported, AppCode will suggest you to add the corresponding import automatically, or even add the import when you complete code. Moreover, with a number of code changes, some imports may become unused, these will be highlighted in the editor. To easily clean up your code, use Optimize Imports action that will remove unused, excessive and duplicating imports in your project.</li>
<li>AppCode can automatically surround highlighted code in if/else, while, for statements and the like.
Refactoring is one of the key features of any decent IDE. Xcode only support some basic refactoring features and they not always work as they should. AppCode has without any doubt the best refactoring tools a developer could ever dream of. Xcode has still a long way to go on this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unit Testing</h2>

<p>AppCode does have support for Unit Testing. In fact it support both the OCUnit and Kiwi testing frameworks. I&#39;m a bit disappointed, tough, that unlike the premium version of JetBrains&#39; IntelliJ IDE for Java, AppCode doesn&#39;t seem to have a code coverage feature. That would have made the difference between AppCode and Xcode, for me at least, and would have probably made me use AppCode instead of Xcode, if not for everything else, but for unit testing at least.</p>

<p>As it is at the time of this writing I don&#39;t feel either Xcode or AppCode to be particularly superior to each other on this field but AppCode has a nice refactoring feature that allows to create a test class with just a couple of clicks from an existing class&#39; interface or implementation file.</p>

<h2>Version Control</h2>

<p>Also on the version control side, I feel I can give no more than a tie to both IDEs. They both support the most common used VCS like SVN and Git. I don&#39;t personally use this features neither in Xcode nor AppCode: I like to use the Terminal or dedicated tools like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview">SourceTree</a> to manage my repositories.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>Mixed Pros for AppCode:</p>

<ul>
<li>Highly customizable</li>
<li>Has nice color schemes like the &#39;Darcula&#39; one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mixed Cons for AppCode:</p>

<ul>
<li>AppCode&#39;s editor is quite clumsy with code indentation. Unlike Xcode, it doesn&#39;t keep you for jumping to any column in any editor&#39;s row. If you&#39;re only used to Xcode it will feel quite awkward to write code in AppCode at the beginning. If you use other JetBrains&#39; IDEs though, code editing works just the same way as those other IDEs and you won&#39;t have any problem with it.</li>
<li>Documentation looks better in Xcode and it&#39;s much more intuitive to have it pop in while writing or highlighting a method or class name.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>AppCode is generally a good IDE but the UI and performance are not ideal. Add to that the need to have Xcode installed on your machine and the lack of support for editing some key files like Storyboards and Core Data Models and you won&#39;t really have reasons not to use Xcode as your primary editor. Moreover, Instruments and other performance tuning tools are only available through Apple&#39;s IDE. <strong>Why then use a different app if you&#39;re coming back to Xcode most of the time anyway?</strong> Is some cool refactoring feature the only reason to switch? I definitely don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>Some people also argue in favour of Xcode that all articles and tutorials on the web for Cocoa(-Touch) development use it - quite understandably - but I don&#39;t believe that is a real pro in favour of Xcode over any other editor. What I&#39;d add to what I&#39;ve already said, is that Apple is spending a great deal of effort on Xcode and we saw that both with Xcode 4 and, for those of you who could, with Xcode 5. I&#39;m sure more has yet to come, especially in the Unit Testing and Continuous Integration areas. Moreover, any new feature that comes with it or with Objective-C itself, are under Apple&#39;s control, which gives you another reason to stick with their tools.</p>

<p>Those are the reasons why I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ll ever go back to AppCode again. If you have any thoughts on this argument I&#39;d like to hear them in the comments below!</p>

A couple of days ago I wrote an article about [contracting and how it compares to other forms for _employed work_](% post_url 2015-08-19-contracting-demystified-part-1 %) giving a definition of what "employed work" means to me. 

Today I wanted to touch on what it takes to become a contractor in the UK, instead, but since my friend and former colleague Tadas Tamo≈°auskas also wrote about it in the UK in the form a [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tadast/switching-to-contracting-uk), I'll simply refer to his post this time. :blush:

Last night I read an article on ‘The Loop’ by Jim Dalrymple titled "[A new level of respect for Apple](http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/03/09/a-new-level-of-respect-for-apple/)". In summary it prises the company for - among other things - having developed and open sourced [ResearchKit](http://www.apple.com/researchkit/), showing once more that they actually care more than just profits - they want to make people’s life better.

In his own words:

>As I sat listening to Jeff Williams talk about ResearchKit, I thought to myself, this is why I love Apple — they care. They don’t just talk the talk and put out press releases about massive donations they make to charities, they are actually making a difference and putting the power of the most successful company in the world behind what they say. […]

>Apple is a products and services company. They are a very rich company. They have proven today that they care about more than just profits — Bravo.

I couldn’t say that better. **This is why I love Apple**. Here’s the video the company prepared for the launch of ResearchKit.
